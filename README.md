# openrouter.ai in Terminal

Simple terminal app to use OpenRouter.ai with your personal API keys. Ask questions directly from your terminal and get AI responses instantly. 

Please note that free models on openrouter.ai (those with :free in their slug) are typically limited to 50 requests per day if you have not purchased credits. A request on OpenRouter.ai is defined as a single API call or message sent to the model‚Äîessentially, each question or prompt you send, regardless of its length or the number of tokens involved. For 99% of people using this script, is more that enough. These limits apply per account, not per model. Switching between free models does not reset your daily quota. Please read their documentation for more: https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits

### Important Note
This CLI tool now supports ongoing, contextual chat with the AI.
Unlike the old one-shot version (ask once, get one reply), this new version maintains the full conversation history during a session ‚Äî so you can chat back and forth naturally, with context.

## Prerequisites

- `curl` (usually pre-installed on most systems)
- `jq` for JSON parsing

### Installing jq

```bash
sudo apt install jq
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage with Sample Output

```bash
./ai.sh

üí¨ Start a conversation! Type your message and press Enter (Ctrl+C to exit)

üßë cerebrux: What's the capital of Greece?

ü§ñ Mistral AI:
Athens is both the historical heart and the modern capital of Greece

üßë cerebrux: Did they have a co-capital there?

ü§ñ Mistral AI:
Thessaloniki is widely recognized as Greece's "second city" due to its size and economic 
power.
The term "co-capital" (**œÉœÖŒºœÄœÅœâœÑŒµœçŒøœÖœÉŒ±** - symprot√©vousa) when applied to Thessaloniki 
is an honorary, historical, and cultural designation reflecting its immense importance.
```

```
## Creating a Terminal Alias (Recommended)

For easier access, you can create an alias so you can use the script from anywhere without typing the full path:

**Option 1: Temporary alias (current session only)**
```bash
alias ai='/path/to/your/openrouter.ai/ai.sh'
```

**Option 2: Permanent alias (recommended)**

1. **For Bash users** - Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/openrouter.ai
   echo "alias ai='$(pwd)/ai.sh'" >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **For Zsh users** - Add to your `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/openrouter.ai
   echo "alias ai='$(pwd)/ai.sh'" >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Manual method** - Edit your shell config file:
   ```bash
   # Open your shell config file
   nano ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh users
   
   # Add this line (replace with your actual path):
   alias ai='/full/path/to/openrouter.ai/ai.sh'
   
   # Reload your shell config
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

**After setting up the alias, you can use it from anywhere:**
```bash
# Instead of ./ai.sh question
# Works from any directory
cd ~/Documents
ai explain machine learning
```

## Configuration

### Changing the AI Model

You can change the AI model by editing the `OPENROUTER_MODEL` variable in your `.env` file. The `.env` file now includes a comprehensive list of free models - simply uncomment the one you want to use:

```bash
# Leave empty or unset to use the default model
OPENROUTER_MODEL=

# Or uncomment one of the many free models listed in .env
# OPENROUTER_MODEL=qwen/qwq-32b:free
# OPENROUTER_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free
# OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free
```
Check your `.env` file for the complete list.

**Note:** If `OPENROUTER_MODEL` is not set or left empty, the script will use the default Mistral model. Simply uncomment one of the free models in your `.env` file to use a different model.

### Common Issues

1. **"jq: command not found"**
   - Install jq using the instructions above

2. **"Error: .env file not found"**
   - Make sure you have a `.env` file in the same directory as `ai.sh`
   - Check that your API key is properly set in the `.env` file

3. **"Error: OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set"**
   - Verify your `.env` file contains: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-actual-key`
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces around the `=` sign

4. **Empty, Invalid model, or other errors**
   - Check that your `OPENROUTER_MODEL` setting in `.env` is correct
   - Verify the model name is available on OpenRouter
   - Leave `OPENROUTER_MODEL=` empty to use the default model

5. **Empty or error responses**
   - Carefully read the message response and act accordingly
   - Verify your API key is valid and active
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded any rate limits

### üêõ Debug Mode

To enable raw API response output for troubleshooting, run the script with:

```bash
DEBUG=true ./ai.sh
```
